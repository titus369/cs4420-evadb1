Run EvaDB

Copy the following Python code to a file called run_evadb.py.

The program runs a SQL query for listing all the built-in functions in EvaDB. It consists of importing and connecting to EvaDB, and then running the query. The queryâ€™s result is returned as a Dataframe.


----
# Import the EvaDB package
import evadb

# Connect to EvaDB and get a database cursor for running queries
cursor = evadb.connect().cursor()

# List all the built-in functions in EvaDB
print(cursor.query("SHOW FUNCTIONS;").df())
----
Now, run the Python program:

python -m run_evadb.py
You should see a list of built-in functions (with different filenames) including but not limited to the following:

        name                                             inputs  ...                                               impl metadata

Illustrative AI Query
Here is an illustrative EvaQL query that analyzes the sentiment of restaurant food reviews and responds to them.

--- This AI query analyses the sentiment of restaurant food reviews stored
--- in a database table and generates a response to negative food reviews
--- using another ChatGPT call to address the concerns shared in the review
SELECT
    ChatGPT("Respond to the review with a solution to address the reviewer's concern",
    review)
FROM
    postgres_data.review_table
WHERE
    ChatGPT("Is the review positive or negative?", review) = "negative";
More details on this usecase is available in the Sentiment Analysis page.
